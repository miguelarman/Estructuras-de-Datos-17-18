POPULATION

Population of the database was a difficult task because firstly we found out that in postgres the temporary tables do not work as it was explained in class
so we had to create manually the tables and the once we had the data in the definitive format drop them. All the fields in the "temporarry" that we created were
of the datatype varchar. Thanks to that we could use the command copy and store all the information given, we had some trouble because the encoding of the files
was too old and we had to change it. 
Once we had the data stored in the temporary tables we had to do the cast to convert every field to it suitable datatype, to do this we used a lot the command cast
that turns strings into integer, numeric, date... etc. We had some trouble converting certaing string into numeric because the decimal coma in psql is a dot and 
in the files given they used coma and dot arbitrarily, to do this we changed the string and replaced every coma with a dot and then we could do the cast.
Also there was trouble because the files given were so badly designed and filled that there were fields without any information or even with the information of other
column, so we discarded all the entries that did not have all the fields filled up with the right information. Other trouble we found was that in the table isbn-prices
there were a lot of isbn of a lot of books but most of them did not have any prize, so we filled the field prize with 0.0. After doing all these changes wich code in sql
is provided in the file 'populate.txt' we got the definitive tables with significantly few data because most of the data provided on the original files was totally
corrupted and we had to make a great clean up.
